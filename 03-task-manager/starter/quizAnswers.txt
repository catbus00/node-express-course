### Quickly explain how middleware is used in an Express application. ###
Middleware is executed after a server receives the request and 
before the controller actions send the response. 
It has access to the request object, response object, and helps 
to process the request before the server sends the response. 

### What does CRUD stand for? ###
CREATE, READ, UPDATE and DELETE

### You are careful to store your sensitive information in a .env file. ###
### How do you get your app to access the information in the .env file? ###
You can have the app access an .env.local file. You can use a library or method to read the values from the .env file, loading them 
as environment variables in the app. 
### How do you protect the contents of the .env file so that it is not stored in your Github repository? ###
It needs to be saved as a hidden file with a .env (e.g., .env.local) and added to .gitignore. 
This ensures that gitignore will not publish your contents to a public repository, effectively keeping the file private.
